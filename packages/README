OpenSSH Packages
================

This directory will contain the debian packages for the latest --
the _very_ latest, bleeding-edge version -- of OpenSSH. The
`Dockerfile` in the parent directory contains the instructions for
building them, and the `docker-compose.yml` file has instructions
for performing the build, copying the packages to this directory,
and tearing down the image afterward.
